I understand You're looking for a React Native developer ; The classic way I like to start on apps is using the React Native Typescript template as it allows for more scalability, So I'll give you a brief example on how I would like to approach developing a basic app like this:

1) Login and sign up screens ( we can include some social media authentication )
2) Home / Menu screen where we feature your products/ideas
3) Functionality screens
4) A settings screen where they can change their info or modify the app for their liking
5) Communicate with you on what the other screen might entail

I'm not gonna take any more of your time, so I'm going to keep this short for now. You can find a picture in the attached section that contains several screenshots of some apps I've made and another 2 links below so that you can see my previous work.

1. Be clear on requirements
2. Produce quality code
3. Set up the right environments for QA like jest
4. Conduct test coverage and tests cases review sessions regularly ( every coding session )
5. Communicate with the client about my progress and take their input on what can be improved
