I took a look at the , I would approach the developing phase for upgrading your app in these steps:

1) Take a good look at your codebase to understand the programming concepts and practices being used
2) Communicate with you on what I understand the bugs you need fixed entail or the features you want add would look like
3) Fork your code onto my mac and start working on the bugs to be pushed to a separate branch and be ready for a PR
4) Work with you on the testing process to ensure everything is as you expect and fix any bugs we might encounter

I'm not gonna take any more of your time, so I'm going to keep this short for now. You can find a picture in the attached section that contains several screenshots of some apps I've made so that you can see my previous work.
